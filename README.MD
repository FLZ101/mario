## About

The toy x86 os MARIO is written with Linux-1.3 as a reference. It is compiled using mingw32 (gcc version 4.8.1). MARIO has Virtual Memory Management, Process Management and very simple Virtual File System. Ramdisk is the only device supported and a toy ramdisk filesystem mariofs is the only filesystem supported. MARIO can read and write directories and files, and execute executables in specific PE format. Pipe, tty and ...... are not implemented yet :-(
